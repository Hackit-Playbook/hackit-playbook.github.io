<h3>List the stakeholders</h3>

On the left hand-side of the board, write the key stakeholders involved in delivering the goal. For example, in housing repairs it might be tenants and leaseholders, contact centre, repair staff. 

<h3>Write the ending on the right </h3>

Write out the [critical path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_path_method) that need to be followed to produce the end result. Keep this simple for now, avoiding the complexity of rules. For example - ‘assess eligibility’ is better than setting out all of the qualification rules.
