<h3>Make a list </h3>
Ask everyone on your team to come up with a list of products or services to review. These should be inspirational. Remind people to think outside of local government;)

<h3>Give a demo</h3>
Each person who suggested a product or service should give a brief presentation to the whole team, showing what’s good about it. 

<h3>Capture big ideas</h3>
Write on the whiteboard the big ideas behind the products that might be useful. Make a quick sketch of that inspiring component, write a simple headline above it and note the source underneath. 

When set alongside your map, you’ve now got:
<ul><li>an initial area of focus,</li>
<li>insights about what matters most, what we already know, and what constraints we face</li>
<li>external stimuli - what does a great product or service look like?</li></ul>

<h3>Divide or swarm</h3>
You’ve now got a choice - do you divide the team up to look at two or more elements of the map, or do you all swarm into a single focus.
