Create a storyboard to show the service or product from start to finish

<ol><li>Draw a grid</li>
<li>Choose an opening scene: how do your users find the service exists?</li>
<li>Complete the storyboard</li>
<li>Include sufficient detail that no one has to ask ‘what happens next?’ or ‘What goes here’</li>
<li>When in doubt, take risks - don’t look for small fixed but favour risky solutions to test</li>
<li>Keep the story to 15 minutes or less </li></ol>
