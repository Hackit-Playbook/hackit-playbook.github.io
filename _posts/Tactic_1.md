title: Tactic 1 : Defining your challenge
---

<h2>The bigger the challenge, the better the sprint</h2>

For example
1, High stakes - a big problem which is likely to require considerable investment of time and money to solve. A sprint can check the direction of travel to reduce risks of heading off in the wrong direction

2. Not enough time
Helping generate good solutions, quickly

3. Just plain stuck
Generate a fresh approach to problem solving

<h4>Setting up the team</h4>
Ensure a decision maker is on the team. Sell it in the following terms:

# We’ll make rapid progress
# It’s an experiment
# Explain what you will sacrifice to do this (in terms of existing commitments)
# It’s about focus

The ideal team is seven people or fewer. Try to put together people who don’t usually work together. Consider the following roles:
# Decider
# Decider
# Policy expert
# Comms expert
# Frontline staff expert
# user expert
# Design expert

Pick a facilitator, and try to find a troublemaker. If you need extra experts, schedule them for day one.
