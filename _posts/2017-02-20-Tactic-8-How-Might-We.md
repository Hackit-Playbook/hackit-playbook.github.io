Each person writes their own notes, one at a time on different Post-Its. Each Post-It begins ‘How Might We’ (write HMW in the top corner for speed). Convert your thinking into questions. These will often be responses to the interviews 

Organise the notes in themes or groups on the wall. Give each theme or group a label.
